# Brewdog-punk-api
This project shows how APIs can be used with the json library in python to retrieve data on the network. This particular example uses the punk ipa API to allow a user to specify certain variables that returns a list of beers.

A summary of my personal development: 
 - Developed a working knowledge of accessing JSON endpoints from a url and how to use these within Python.
 - Used the Punk IPA API to return a recommended list of beers based on user specified variables.
 - Used the JSON Python library to retrieve data from a url.
 - Maintained the ability to parse lists and dictionaries nested within each other.
